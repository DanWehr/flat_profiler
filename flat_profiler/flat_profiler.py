    A time limit must be provided, where one of two callback functions will be run depending on whether the total
    execution time of the function is below (exclusive) or above (inclusive) of the decorated function. By default
    simple INFO-level logging functions are provided that will report only the total function time if that total is
    below the time limit, and if above it will also log the sum of times for each call.

    Call times are recorded to a dictionary that is local to the decorated function. Keys are the name of calls, and the
    values are lists of execution times. This list is cleared after each execution. You can access this dictionary by
    providing alternative callbacks.

    Callback parameters include total execution time, time limit, the callable time dictionary, and a reference to the
    decorated function.

    Args:
        time_limit (float): Threshold that determines which callback run after decorated function runs.
        below_callback (ProfilerCallback | None): Called when execution time is under the time limit.
        above_callback (ProfilerCallback | None): Called when execution time is equal to or over the time limit.
        ignore_builtins (bool): Whether to skip wrapping builtin calls. Must be False to use whitelist. Default True.
        blacklist (set[str] | None): Call names that should not be wrapped. String literal subscripts should not use
            quotes, e.g. use a name of `"a[b]"` to match code written as `a["b"]()`. Subscripts can be wildcards using an
            asterisk, like `"a[*]"` which would match all of `a[0]()` and `a[val]()` and `a["key"]()` etc.
        whitelist (set[str] | None): Call names that should be wrapped. Allows wildcards like blacklist.
        rewrite_details (dict | None): If provided the given dict will be updated to store the original function object
            and original/new source in the keys `original_func`, `original_source`, and `new_source`.

    Returns:
        Callable: A decorator that will replace the wrapped function.
